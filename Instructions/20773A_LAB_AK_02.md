## Exercise 1: Importing and transforming CSV data

#### Task 1: Import the data for the year 2000
1. Log in to the **LON-DEV** VM as **Adatum\\AdatumAdmin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. Start your R development environment of choice (Visual Studio, or RStudio), and create a new R file.
3. Add the following statement to the R file and run it to set the working directory:
    ```
	setwd("E:\\Labfiles\\Lab02")
    ```
4. Add and run the following statements to import the first 10 rows of the 2000.csv file into a data frame:
    ```
	flightDataSampleCsv <- "2000.csv"
	flightDataSample <- rxImport(flightDataSampleCsv, numRows = 10)
    ```
5. Add and run the following statement to view the structure of the data frame:
    ```
	rxGetVarInfo(flightDataSample)
    ```
6. Add and run the following statement to create the **flighDataColumns** vector:
    ```
	flightDataColumns <- c("Year" = "factor",
	"DayofMonth" = "factor",
	"DayOfWeek" = "factor",
	"UniqueCarrier" = "factor",
	"Origin" = "factor",
	"Dest" = "factor",
	"CancellationCode" = "factor"
	)
    ```
7. Add and run the following statements to import the CSV data into the 2000.xdf file:
    ```
	flightDataXdf <- "2000.xdf"
	rxOptions(reportProgress = 1)
	flightDataSampleXDF <- rxImport(inData = flightDataSampleCsv, outFile = flightDataXdf, overwrite = TRUE, append = "none", colClasses = flightDataColumns)
    ```
8. Add and run the following statement to view the structure of the data frame:
    ```
	rxGetVarInfo(flightDataXdf)
    ```
9. Open File Explorer and move to the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab02** folder. Verify that the **2000.csv** file is approximately **155 MB** in size, whereas the **2000.xdf** file is just under **28 MB**.

#### Task 2: Compare the performance of the data files
1. Return to your R environment.
2. Add and run the following statement to generate a summary across all numeric fields in the CSV file. Make a note of the timings reported by the **system.time** function:
    ```
	system.time(csvDelaySummary <- rxSummary(~., flightDataSampleCsv))
    ```
3. Add and run the following statement to generate the same summary for the XDF file. Compare the timings reported by the **system.time** function against those for the CSV file:
    ```
	system.time(xdfDelaySummary <- rxSummary(~., flightDataSampleXDF))
    ```
4. The timings for the XDF file should be significantly quicker than those of the CSV file. If you need to satisfy yourself that both statements are performing the same task, add print statements that display the values of the **csvDelaySummary** and **xdfDelaySummary** variables, as follows:
    ```
	print(csvDelaySummary)
	print(xdfDelaySummary)
    ```
5. Add and run the following statement to generate a cross-tabulation that summarizes cancellations by month in the CSV file. Make a note of the timings:
    ```
	system.time(csvCrossTabInfo <- rxCrossTabs(~as.factor(Month):as.factor(Cancelled == 1), flightDataSampleCsv))
    ```
6. Add and run the following statement to generate the same cross-tabulation for the XDF file. Compare the timings against those for the CSV file:
    ```
	system.time(xdfCrossTabInfo <- rxCrossTabs(~as.factor(Month):as.factor(Cancelled == 1), flightDataSampleXDF))
    ```
7. Add and run the following statement to generate a cube that summarizes cancellations by month in the CSV file. Make a note of the timings:
    ```
	system.time(csvCubeInfo <- rxCube(~as.factor(Month):as.factor(Cancelled), flightDataSampleCsv))
    ```
8. Add and run the following statement to generate the same cube for the XDF file. Compare the timings against those for the CSV file:
    ```
	system.time(xdfCubeInfo <- rxCube(~as.factor(Month):as.factor(Cancelled), flightDataSampleXDF))
    ```
9. Add and run the following statement to tidy up the workspace:
    ```
	rm(flightDataSample, flightDataSampleXDF, csvDelaySummary, xdfDelaySummary, csvCrossTabInfo, xdfCrossTabInfo, csvCubeInfo, xdfCubeInfo)
    ```
**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have created a new XDF file containing the airline delay data for the year 2000, and you will have performed some operations to test its performance.

## Exercise 2: Combing and transforming data

#### Task 1: Copy the data files to R Server
1. On the LON-DEV VM, open a command prompt window.
2. Run the following commands:
    ```
	net use \\LON-RSVR\Data
	copy E:\Labfiles\Lab02\200?.csv \\LON-RSVR\Data
    ```
3. Verify that all the files are copied successfully.

#### Task 2: Create a remote session

1. Return to your R environment.
2. Add the following statement to your R script, and run it. This statement creates a remote connection to the LON-RSVR VM. When prompted, specify the username **admin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**:
    ```
	remoteLogin("http://LON-RSVR.ADATUM.COM:12800", session = TRUE, diff = TRUE, commandline = TRUE)
    ```
3. At the **REMOTE\>** prompt, add and run the following command to temporarily pause the remote session:
    ```
	pause()
    ```
4. Add and run the following statement. This statement copies the local variable **flightDataColumns** to the remote session:
    ```
	putLocalObject(c("flightDataColumns"))
    ```
5. Add and run the following statement to resume the remote session:
    ```
	resume()
    ```
6. Add and run the following statement. This statement lists the variables in the remote session. Verify that the **flightDataColumns** variable is listed:
    ```
	ls()
    ```

#### Task 3: Import the flight delay data to an XDF file
1. Add and run the following statements. This code imports and transforms a subset of the data comprising the first 1,000 rows from the 2000.csv file:
    ```
	flightDataSampleXDF <- rxImport(inData = "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\2000.csv", outFile = "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\Sample.xdf", overwrite = TRUE, append = "none", colClasses = flightDataColumns,
	transforms = list(
	Delay = ArrDelay + DepDelay + ifelse(is.na(CarrierDelay), 0, CarrierDelay) + ifelse(is.na(WeatherDelay), 0, WeatherDelay) + ifelse(is.na(NASDelay), 0, NASDelay) + ifelse(is.na(SecurityDelay), 0, SecurityDelay) + ifelse(is.na(LateAircraftDelay), 0, LateAircraftDelay),
	MonthName = factor(month.name[as.numeric(Month)], levels=month.name)),
	rowSelection = (Cancelled == 0),
	varsToDrop = c("FlightNum", "TailNum", "CancellationCode"),
	numRows = 1000
	)
    ```
2. Add and run the following statement to examine the first few rows in the XDF file:
    ```
	head(flightDataSampleXDF, 100)
    ```
3. Using File Explorer, delete the file **Sample.xdf** from the **\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data** share.
4. In your R environment, add and run the following statements. This code imports and transforms all of the files in the **\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data** share:
    ```
	rxOptions(reportProgress = 1)
	delayXdf <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\FlightDelayData.xdf"
	flightDataCsvFolder <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\"
	flightDataXDF <- rxImport(inData = flightDataCsvFolder, outFile = delayXdf, overwrite = TRUE, append = ifelse(file.exists(delayXdf), "rows", "none"), colClasses = flightDataColumns,
	transforms = list(
	Delay = ArrDelay + DepDelay + ifelse(is.na(CarrierDelay), 0, CarrierDelay) + ifelse(is.na(WeatherDelay), 0, WeatherDelay) + ifelse(is.na(NASDelay), 0, NASDelay) + ifelse(is.na(SecurityDelay), 0, SecurityDelay) + ifelse(is.na(LateAircraftDelay), 0, LateAircraftDelay),
	MonthName = factor(month.name[as.numeric(Month)], levels=month.name)),
	rowSelection = ( Cancelled == 0 ),
	varsToDrop = c("FlightNum", "TailNum", "CancellationCode"),
	rowsPerRead = 500000
	)
    ```
5. Add and run the following statement to close the remote session:
    ```
	exit
    ```

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have created a new XDF file containing the cumulative airline delay data for the years 2000 through 2008, and you will have performed some transformations on this data.

## Exercise 3: Incorporating data from SQL Server into an XDF file

#### Task 1: Import the SQL Server data
1. Add the following statement to your R script and run it. This code creates a data source that connects to the **Airports** table in the **AirlineData** database on the **LON-SQLR** server:
    ```
	conString <- "Server=LON-SQLR;Database=AirlineData;Trusted_Connection=TRUE"
	airportData <- RxSqlServerData(connectionString = conString, table = "Airports")
    ```
2. Add and run the following statement. This statement displays the first six rows from the **Airports** table:
    ```
	head(airportData)
    ```
3. Add and run the following statements. This code imports the data from the SQL Server database into a data frame, and converts all string data to factors:
    ```
	airportInfo <- rxImport(inData = airportData, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
    ```
4. Add and run the following statement that displays the first six rows of the data frame. Verify that they are the same as the original SQL Server data:
    ```
	head(airportInfo)
    ```

#### Task 2: Add state information to the flight delay XDF data
1.  Add the following statement to your R script and run it. This statement creates a remote connection to the LON-RSVR VM. When prompted, specify the username **admin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**:
    ```
	remoteLogin("http://LON-RSVR.ADATUM.COM:12800", session = TRUE, diff = TRUE, commandline = TRUE)
    ```
2. At the **REMOTE\>** prompt, add and run the following command to temporarily pause the remote session:
    ```
	pause()
    ```
3. Add and run the following statement that copies the local **airportInfo** data frame to the remote session:
    ```
	putLocalObject(c("airportInfo"))
    ```
4. Add and run the following statement to resume the remote session:
    ```
	resume()
    ```
5. Add and run the following statements that import the flight delay data and combine the state information from the airport data:
    ```
	enhancedDelayDataXdf <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\EnhancedFlightDelayData.xdf"
	flightDelayDataXdf <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\FlightDelayData.xdf"
	enhancedXdf <- rxImport(inData = flightDelayDataXdf, outFile = enhancedDelayDataXdf,
	overwrite = TRUE, append = "none", rowsPerRead = 500000,
	transforms = list(OriginState = stateInfo$state[match(Origin, stateInfo$iata)],
	DestState = stateInfo$state[match(Dest, stateInfo$iata)]),
	transformObjects = list(stateInfo = airportInfo)
	)
    ```
6. Add and run the following statement that displays the first six rows of XDF file. Verify that they include the **OriginState** and **DestState** variables:
    ```
	head(enhancedXdf)
    ```

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have augmented the flight delay data with the state in which the origin and destination airports are located.

## Exercise 4: Refactoring data and generating summaries

#### Task 1: Examine delay intervals by airport and state
1. In the remote session, add and run the following statement. This code defines an expression that factorizes the Delay variable into the required set of intervals:
    ```
	delayFactor <- expression(list(Delay = cut(Delay, breaks = c(0, 1, 30, 60, 120, 180, 181), labels = c("No delay", "Up to 30 mins", "30 mins - 1 hour", "1 hour to 2 hours", "2 hours to 3 hours", "More than 3 hours"))))
	```
2. Add and run the following statements. The first statement generates a cross-tabulation that summarizes the delay by origin airport. It uses the **delayFactor** expression to transform the **Delay** variable. The second statement displays the results:
    ```
	originAirportDelays <- rxCrossTabs(formula = ~ Origin:Delay, data = enhancedXdf,
	transforms = delayFactor
	)
	print(originAirportDelays)
    ```
3. Add and run the following statements to generate and display the cross-tabulation of delays by destination airport:
    ```
	destAirportDelays <- rxCrossTabs(formula = ~ Dest:Delay, data = enhancedXdf,
	transforms = delayFactor
	)
	print(destAirportDelays)
    ```
4. Add and run the following statements to generate and display the cross-tabulation of delays by origin state:
    ```
	originStateDelays <- rxCrossTabs(formula = ~ OriginState:Delay, data = enhancedXdf,
	transforms = delayFactor
	)
	print(originStateDelays)
    ```
5. Add and run the following statements to generate and display the cross-tabulation of delays by destination state:
    ```
	destStateDelays <- rxCrossTabs(formula = ~ DestState:Delay, data = enhancedXdf,
	transforms = delayFactor
	)
	print(destStateDelays)
    ```
6. Add and run the following command to close the remote session:
    ```
	exit
    ```

#### Task 2: Summarize delay intervals by airport and state
1.  Add and run the following statements to build and install dplyrXdf:
    ```
	install.packages("dplyr")
	install.packages("devtools")
	devtools::install_github("RevolutionAnalytics/dplyrXdf@v0.9.2")
	library(dplyr)
	library(dplyrXdf)
    ```
2. Add and run the following code to create a data source that retrieves the required columns from the XDF data:
    ```
	enhancedDelayDataXdf <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\EnhancedFlightDelayData.xdf"
	essentialData <-RxXdfData(enhancedDelayDataXdf, varsToKeep = c("Delay", "Origin", "Dest", "OriginState", "DestState"))
    ```
3. Add and run the following code. This code is a dplyrXdf pipeline that calculates the mean delay by origin airport and sorts them in descending order. The airport with the longest delays will be at the top:
    ```
	originAirportStats <- filter(essentialData, !is.na(Delay)) %>%
	select(Origin, Delay) %>%
	group_by(Origin) %>%
	summarise(mean_delay = mean(Delay), .method = 1) %>% \# Use methods 1 or 2 only
	arrange(desc(mean_delay)) %>%
	persist("\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\temp.xdf")
	head(originAirportStats, 100)
	```
4. Add and run the following code that calculates the mean delay by destination airport and sorts them in descending order:
    ```
	destAirportStats <- filter(essentialData, !is.na(Delay)) %>%
	select(Dest, Delay) %>%
	group_by(Dest) %>%
	summarise(mean_delay = mean(Delay), .method = 1) %>%
	arrange(desc(mean_delay)) %>%
	persist("\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\temp.xdf")
	head(destAirportStats, 100)
    ```
5. Add and run the following code that calculates the mean delay by origin state and sorts them in descending order:
    ```
	originStateStats <- filter(essentialData, !is.na(Delay)) %>%
	select(OriginState, Delay) %>%
	group_by(OriginState) %>%
	summarise(mean_delay = mean(Delay), .method = 1) %>%
	arrange(desc(mean_delay)) %>%
	persist("\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\temp.xdf")
	head(originStateStats, 100)
    ```
6. Add and run the following code that calculates the mean delay by destination state and sorts them in descending order:
    ```
	destStateStats <- filter(essentialData, !is.na(Delay)) %>%
	select(DestState, Delay) %>%
	group_by(DestState) %>%
	summarise(mean_delay = mean(Delay), .method = 1) %>%
	arrange(desc(mean_delay)) %>%
	persist("\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\temp.xdf")
	head(destStateStats, 100)
	```
7. Save the script as **Lab2Script.R** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab02** folder, and close your R development environment.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have examined flight delays by origin and destination airport and state.
