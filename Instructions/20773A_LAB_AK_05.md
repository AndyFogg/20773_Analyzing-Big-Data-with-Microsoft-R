# Lab: Parallelizing analysis operations

## Exercise 1: Capturing flight delay times and frequencies

#### Task 1: Create a shared folder
If you have not already created the **\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data** share in an earlier lab, perform the following steps:
1. Log in to the LON-RSVR VM as **Adatum\\AdatumAdmin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. Using File Explorer, create a new folder named **C:\\Data**.
3. In File Explorer, right-click the **C:\\Data** folder, click **Share with**, and then click **Specific people**.
4. In the **File Sharing** dialog box, click the drop-down list, click **Everyone**, and then click **Add**.
5. In the lower pane, click the **Everyone** row, and set the **Permission Level** to **Read/Write**.
6. Click **Share**.
7. In the **File Sharing** dialog box, verify that the file share is named **\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data**, and then click **Done**.

#### Task 2: Copy the data
1. Log in to the **LON-DEV** VM as **Adatum\\AdatumAdmin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. Open a command prompt window.
3. At the command prompt, run the following commands:
    ```
	net use \\LON-RSVR\Data
	copy E:\Labfiles\Lab05\FlightDelayData.xdf \\LON-RSVR\Data
    ```
4. If the **Overwrite** message appears, type **y**, and then press Enter.
5. Verify that the files are copied successfully, and then close the command prompt window.

#### Task 3: Create the class generator for the PemaFlightDelays class
01. Start your R development environment of choice (Visual Studio Tools, or RStudio), and create a new R file.
02. Add the following statement to your R script, and run it. This statement installs the **dplyr** package:
    ```
	install.packages("dplyr")
    ```
03. Add the following code to your R script, and run it. These statements bring the **dplyr** and **RevoPemaR** libraries into scope:
    ```
	library(dplyr)
	library(RevoPemaR)
    ```
04. Add the following code to your R script, but do not run it yet. Code defines the **PemaFlightDelays** class generator:
    ```
	PemaFlightDelays <- setPemaClass(
		Class = "PemaFlightDelays",
		contains = "PemaBaseClass",
	)
    ```
05. Add the following code to your R script, after the **contains** line, but before the closing brace. Do not run it yet. This code adds the fields to the class:
    ```
    fields = list(
    	totalFlights = "numeric",
    	totalDelays = "numeric",
    	origin = "character",
    	dest = "character",
    	airline = "character",
    	delayTimes = "vector",
    	results = "list"
    ),
    ```
06. Add the following code to your R script, after the **fields** list, but before the closing brace. Do not run it yet. This code defines the **initialize** method:
    ```
    methods = list(
    	initialize = function(originCode = "", destinationCode = "",
    	airlineCode = "", ...) {
    
    	'initialize fields'
    	callSuper(...)
    	usingMethods(.pemaMethods)
    	totalFlights <<- 0
    	totalDelays <<- 0
    	delayTimes <<- vector(mode="numeric", length=0)
    	origin <<- originCode
    	dest <<- destinationCode
    	airline <<- airlineCode
    },
    ```
07. Add the following code to your R script, after the **initialize** method, but before the closing brace. Do not run it yet. This code defines the **processData** method:
    ```
    processData = function(dataList) {
    	'Generates a vector of delay times for specified variables in the current chunk of data.'
    	data <- as.data.frame(dataList)
    	
		# If no origin was specified, default to the first value in the dataset
    	if (origin == "") {
    		origin <<- as.character(as.character(data$Origin[1]))
    	}
    
    	# If no destination was specified, default to the first value in the dataset
    	if (dest == "") {
    		dest <<- as.character(as.character(data$Dest[1]))
    	}
    
    	# If no airline was specified, default to the first value in the dataset
    	if (airline == "") {
    		airline <<- as.character(as.character(data$UniqueCarrier[1]))
    	}
    
    	# Use dplyr to filter by origin, dest, and airline
    	# update the number of flights
    	# select the Delay variable
    	# only include delayed flights in the results
    	data %>%
    		filter(Origin == origin, Dest == dest, UniqueCarrier == airline) %T>%
    		{totalFlights <<- totalFlights + length(.$Origin)} %>%
    		select(ifelse(is.na(Delay), 0, Delay)) %>%
    		filter(Delay > 0) -> temp
		
    	# Store the result in the delayTimes vector
    	delayTimes <<- c(delayTimes, as.vector(temp[,1]))
    	totalDelays <<- length(delayTimes)
    	invisible(NULL)
    },
    ```
08. Add the following code to your R script, after the **processData** method, but before the closing brace. Do not run it yet. This code defines the **updateResults** method:
    ```
    updateResults = function(pemaFlightDelaysObj) {
    	'Updates total observations and delayTimes vector from another PemaFlightDelays object object.'
    
    	# Update the totalFlights and totalDelays fields
    	totalFlights <<- totalFlights + pemaFlightDelaysObj$totalFlights
    	totalDelays <<- totalDelays + pemaFlightDelaysObj$totalDelays
    
    	# Append the delay data to the delayTimes vector
    	delayTimes <<- c(delayTimes, pemaFlightDelaysObj$delayTimes)
    	invisible(NULL)
    },
    ```
09. Add the following code to your R script, after the **updateResults** method, but before the closing brace. Do not run it yet. This code defines the **processResults** method:
    ```
    processResults = function() {
    	'Generates a list containing the results:'
    	' The first element is the number of flights made by the airline'
    	' The second element is the number of delayed flights'
    	' The third element is the list of delay times'
    	results <<- list("NumberOfFlights" = totalFlights,
    		"NumberOfDelays" = totalDelays,
    		"DelayTimes" = delayTimes)
    	return(results)
        }
    )
    ```
10. Highlight and run the code you have entered in the previous steps, starting at step 4, in this task. Verify that no errors are reported.

#### Task 4: Test the PemaFlightDelays class using a data frame
1. Add the following statement to your R script and run it. This statement creates an instance of the **PemaFlightDelays** class in a variable named **pemaFlightDelaysObj**:
    ```
	pemaFlightDelaysObj <- PemaFlightDelays()
    ```
2. Add the following statement to your R script, and run it. This statement creates a remote connection to the LON-RSVR VM. Specify the username **admin** with the password **Pa55w.rd** when prompted:
    ```
	remoteLogin("http://LON-RSVR.ADATUM.COM:12800", session = TRUE, diff = TRUE, commandline = TRUE)
    ```
3. At the **REMOTE>** prompt, add and run the following command to temporarily pause the remote session:
    ```
	pause()
    ```
4. Add and run the following statement. This statement copies the local variable **pemaFlightDelaysObj** to the remote session:
    ```
	putLocalObject("pemaFlightDelaysObj")
    ```
5. Add and run the following statement to resume the remote session:
    ```
	resume()
    ```
6. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them:
    ```
	install.packages("dplyr")
	library(dplyr)
	library(RevoPemaR)
    ```
7. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them. These statements create a data frame comprising the first 50,000 observations from the **FlightDelayData.xdf** file in the \\\\LON-RSVR\\Data share.
    ```
    flightDelayDataFile <- ("\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\FlightDelayData.xdf")
    flightDelayData <- RxXdfData(flightDelayDataFile)
    testData <- rxDataStep(flightDelayData,
    numRows = 50000)
    ```
8. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them. This code uses the **pemaCompute** function to run the **pemaFlightDelaysObj** object to perform an analysis of flights from "ABE" to "PIT" made by airline "US":
    ```
    result <- pemaCompute(pemaObj = pemaFlightDelaysObj, data = testData, originCode = "ABE", destinationCode = "PIT", airlineCode = "US")
    print(result)
    ```
9. Verify that the results resemble the following data:
    ```
    $NumberOfFlights
    [1] 755
    $NumberOfDelays
    [1] 188
    $DelayTimes
    [1] 3 10 3 16 54 2 61 65 54 12 18 23 92 16 153 7 18 2
    [19] 21 61 2 1 1 4 40 67 1 82 6 3 112 298 39 21 13 2
    [37] 1 12 2 131 474 85 27 352 9 2 49 24 18 60 43 28 126 109
    [55] 40 39 53 34 120 3 274 73 57 3 83 27 58 53 15 8 58 61
    [73] 1 117 34 32 9 19 66 44 2 82 17 21 9 103 2 45 4 64
    [91] 3 48 52 17 5 11 7 1 18 23 43 29 7 46 22 71 16 18
    [109] 9 62 27 120 10 12 11 6 10 4 50 4 1 6 1 129 3 9
    [127] 185 5 11 17 19 171 2 81 3 17 1 33 21 2 45 8 27 29
    [145] 42 25 40 5 1 15 1 59 4 10 6 81 13 45 37 6 9 1
    [163] 7 1 2 2 2 5 109 3 15 7 25 58 17 45 289 5 7 7
    [181] 38 89 3 34 12 15 129 19
    ```
9. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them. This code displays the values of the internal fields in the **pemaFlightDelaysObj** object:
    ```
    print(pemaFlightDelaysObj$delayTimes)
    print(pemaFlightDelaysObj$totalDelays)
    print(pemaFlightDelaysObj$totalFlights)
    print(pemaFlightDelaysObj$origin)
    print(pemaFlightDelaysObj$dest)
    print(pemaFlightDelaysObj$airline)
    ```

#### Task 5: Use the PemaFlightDelays class to analyze XDF data
1. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them. This code creates a subset of the flight delay data as an XDF file with a small block size:
    ```
    flightDelayDataSubsetFile <- ("\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\FlightDelayDataSubset.xdf")
    testData2 <- rxDataStep(flightDelayData, flightDelayDataSubsetFile,
    overwrite = TRUE, numRows = 50000, rowsPerRead = 5000)
    ```
2. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them. This code performs the same analysis as before, but using the XDF file:
    ```
	result <- pemaCompute(pemaObj = pemaFlightDelaysObj, data = testData2, originCode = "ABE", destinationCode = "PIT", airlineCode = "US")
	print(result)
    ```
3. Verify that the results are the same as before (755 flights, with 188 delayed).
4. Add the following statements to your R script, and run them. This code performs the same analysis as before, but using the XDF file:
    ```
	result <- pemaCompute(pemaObj = pemaFlightDelaysObj, data = flightDelayData, originCode = "LAX", destinationCode = "JFK", airlineCode = "DL")
	print(result)
    ```
5. Examine the results. Note the number of flights made, the number of flights that were delayed, and the length of the longest delay.
6. Save the script as **Lab5Script.R** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab05** folder, and close your R development environment.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have created and run a PEMA class that finds the number of times flights that match a specified origin, destination, and airline are delayed—and how long each delay was.
